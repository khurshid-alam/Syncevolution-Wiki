This section explains how to use local syncing for CalDAV and
CardDAV. Both protocols are based on WebDAV and are provided by the
same backend. They share username/password/syncURL properties
defined in their target config.

=== Requirements ===

* Syncevolution >=1.32

* A remote caldav/carddav server with a valid root sync-url(i.e generally http://dav.hostname.com)

* If the server has one URL as starting point instead of DNS auto-discovery then root sync-url is required. 


{i} Fruux caldav/carddav server is used in this example.

= Setup (Calendar-Sync) =

=== Sync Scenario ===

|| '''Fruux Calendar Name''' || '''Evolution Calendar''' || '''Source''' || '''Database''' || '''Peer''' ||
|| Work || Work || workcal || Work ||<:99%|2> fruux ||
|| Personal || Personal || personalcal || Personal ||
{i} One can choose any arbitrary peer name.


Synchronization between work calendars is shown here

== 1. Create a peer for fruux calendar ==

{{{
syncevolution --configure --template webdav syncURL=https://dav.fruux.com:443/ username=yourusernane@email.com password=***** target-config@fruux
}}}
The syncURL is optional if the username is an email address and the server supports auto-discovery of its CalDAV and/or CardDAV services. However, the protocols do not uniquely identify this default collection. The backend tries to make an educated guess, but it might pick the wrong one if the server provides more than one address book or calendar. It is safer to scan for collections manually with --print-databases and then use the URL of the desired collection as value of database.

To scan for collection use following command:

{{{
syncevolution --print-databases backend=caldav username=yourusername "password=*****" syncURL=https://dav.fruux.com:443/
}}}
{i} Fruux does't support auto discovery. One has to provide full remote address-book path for fruux. It may work for other calendar server.

== 2. Create a new source for work calendar ==
{{{
syncevolution --configure backend=evolution-calendar database=Work @default workcal
}}}
{i} If it is already created during other sync processes(i.e google-caledar), then this step is NOT required. 

To list all local databases,one can run following command at terminal-prompt:
{{{
syncevolution --print-databases
}}}

== 3. Find remote calendar (i.e Work) source url in fruux ==

Login to fruux. click Calendars->Work (create a new calendar '''Work''' if necessary) . It will reveal the source url of the calendar. 

{{http://i.imgur.com/zw8fiTV.png}}

Copy the source url.

== 4. Add a remote database to the source (workcal) ==
{{{
syncevolution --configure database=https://dav.fruux.com/calendars/a3298289645/63356588-b183-429d-bc29-0a1a******/ backend=caldav target-config@fruux workcal
}}}
Replace '''database''' with the source url copied from previous step.


== 5. Connect remote calendars with local databases (sync-config) ==
{{{
syncevolution --configure --template SyncEvolution_Client syncURL=local://@Fruux username= password= fruux workcal
}}}

== 6. Add a local database to the source (workcal) ==
{{{
syncevolution --configure sync=two-way database=Work fruux workcal
}}}

== 7. Start syncing (First-Time) ==
{{{
syncevolution --sync refresh-from-remote fruux workcal
}}}

{i} For the first-time sync it is strongly recommended to use '''-- sync refresh-from-remote''' or '''--sync slow''' option during the sync to avoid duplicity.

{X} '''Caution:''' '''"refresh-from-client"''' option '''WILL DELETE EVERYTHING IN EVOLUTION CALENDAR (for caldav/carddav client is remote server & server is local client i.e. syncevolution) AND REPLACE WITH GOOGLE-CALENDAR'''.

To find all possible sync-option run following command at terminal-prompt:
{{{
syncevolution --sync ?
}}}

General sync-options are explained below:


|| '''Sync Option''' || '''Meaning''' ||
|| two-way || Normal two-way sync ||
|| slow || Exchange all data. Recommended for first time sync to avoid duplicity ||
|| refresh-from-remote || Deletes everything on client & replaces with server ||
|| refresh-from-local || Deletes everything on server & replaces with client ||
|| refresh-from-client || Deletes everything on server & replaces with client ('''opposite for caldav/carddav''') ||
|| refresh-from-server || Deletes everything on client & replaces with server ('''opposite for caldav/carddav''') ||

== 8. Start Normal Sync (After first sync) ==
{{{
syncevolution fruux workcal
}}}

This will start '''two-way''' sync which is the default sync-option defined in step 6.

For other calendars repeat '''steps 2,3,4,5,6 & 7''' with separate data-source & calendar-id for each calendar.Multiple data-sources can be synced at the same time:
{{{
syncevolution fruux workcal personalcal
}}}

To sync all sources under a peer run:
{{{
syncevolution fruux
}}}


....to be continued.
